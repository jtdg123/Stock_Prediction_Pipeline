# Stock_Prediction_Pipeline
**Smart Stock Screener**

This project implements a stock screening pipeline that predicts 30-day equity returns using Python, yfinance, and scikit-learn. It engineers technical indicators (moving averages, volatility), trains a Random Forest model, ranks tickers based on predicted performance, and generates visualizations to support data-driven analysis.

**What this repo does:**

*pulls stock data using yfinance
*builds features (moving averages, daily returns, volatility)
*trains a Random Forest regressor for 30-day return
*scores each ticker on the latest date
*builds quick plots (PCA, t-SNE, clusters, heatmap)

**Structure**

*"main_pipeline.py" - download data, build features, train model
*"predict_and_infer.py" - load model, score everything, exporting top picks
*"visualize_and_analyze.py" - generate plots and clustering diagnostics

**Install deps:**
*pip install -r requirements.txt

Run:
*python main_pipeline.py
*python predict_and_infer.py
*python visualize_and_analyze.py

**Next steps (planned):**
*simple backtests (did these predictions actually pan out)
*auto-run cron or airflow
*small web dashboard (streamlit or flask)
